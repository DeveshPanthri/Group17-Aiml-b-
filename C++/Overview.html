                <h1>C++ Overview</h1>
                <h2>What is C++?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.</li>
                    <li>Despite being an 80s creation, C++ has been a popular programming language throughout these years.</li>
                    <li>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications and software systems.</li>
                    <li>C++ is very close to the hardware making it comparatively easy for programmers to give the instructions directly to the system without any intermediary giving programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Why should we learn C++/ Features of C++?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.</li>

                        <li>In today's operating systems, GUIs, and embedded systems, C++ is widely used. </li>
                        
                       <li> It is one of the most popular programming languages for its object-orientedness. C++ is an object-oriented programming language that gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.</li>
                        
                        <li>With C++, you can develop applications or heavy games that can run on different platforms.</li>
                        
                        <li>As C++ is close to other programming languages such as C# and Java, which makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa while it is actually very easy to learn.</li>
