      <section id="intro"> <p> <h1>Loops in C++</h1>The need to perform an action, again and again, with little or no variations in the details each time they are executed is met by a mechanism known as a loop. This involves repeating some code in the program, either a specified number of times or until a particular condition is satisfied. Loop-controlled instructions are used to perform this repetitive operation efficiently ensuring the program doesnâ€™t look redundant at the same time due to the repetitions.</p> <p>Following are the three types of loops in C++ programming:</p> <ul> <li>For Loop</li> <li>While Loop</li> <li>Do While Loop</li> </ul> </section> <section id="for-loop"> <h2>For Loop</h2> <p>A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows us to efficiently write a loop that will execute a specific number of times. The for-loop statement is very specialized. We use a for loop when we already know the number of iterations of that particular piece of code we wish to execute. Although, when we do not know about the number of iterations, we use a while loop which is discussed next.</p> <p>Here is the syntax of a for loop in C++ programming:</p> <pre><code>for (initialise counter; test counter; increment / decrement counter) { // set of statements }</code></pre> <p>Here:</p> <ul> <li><strong>initialize counter:</strong> It will initialize the loop counter value. It is usually <code>i=0</code>.</li> <li><strong>test counter:</strong> This is the test condition, which if found true, the loop continues, otherwise terminates.</li> <li><strong>Increment/decrement counter:</strong> Incrementing or decrementing the counter.</li> <li><strong>Set of statements:</strong> This is the body or the executable part of the for loop or the set of statements that has to repeat itself.</li> </ul> <p>First, the initialization expression will initialize loop variables. The expression <code>i=0</code> executes once when the loop starts. Then the condition <code>i < num</code> is checked. If the condition is true, then the statements inside the body of the loop are executed. After the statements inside the body are executed, the control of the program is transferred to the increment of the variable <code>i</code> by 1. The expression <code>i++</code> modifies the loop variables. Iteratively, the condition <code>i < num</code> is evaluated again.</p> <p>The for loop terminates when <code>i</code> finally becomes greater than <code>num</code>, therefore, making the condition <code>i &lt; num</code> false.</p> </section> <section id="while-loop"> <h2>While Loop</h2> <p>A While loop is also called a pre-tested loop. A while loop allows a piece of code in a program to be executed multiple times, depending upon a given test condition which evaluates to either true or false. The while loop is mostly used in cases where the number of iterations is not known. If the number of iterations is known, then we could also use a for loop as mentioned previously.</p> <p>Following is the syntax for using a while loop:</p> <pre><code>while (condition test) { // Set of statements }</code></pre> <p>The body of a while loop can contain a single statement or a block of statements. The test condition may be any expression that should evaluate as either true or false. The loop iterates while the test condition evaluates to true. When the condition becomes false, it terminates.</p> </section> <section id="do-while-loop"> <h2>Do While Loop</h2> <p>A do-while loop is a little different from a normal while loop. A do-while loop, unlike what happens in a while loop, executes the statements inside the body of the loop before checking the test condition.</p> <p>So even if a condition is false in the first place, the do-while loop would have already run once. A do-while loop is very much similar to a while loop, except for the fact that it is guaranteed to execute the body at least once.</p> <p>Unlike for and while loops, which test the loop condition first, then execute the code written inside the body of the loop, the do-while loop checks its condition at the end of the loop.</p> <p>Following is the syntax for using a do-while loop:</p> <pre><code>do { statements; } while (test condition);</code></pre> </section>
