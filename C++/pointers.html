        <h1>Pointers in C++</h1>
        <p>A pointer is a data type that holds the address of another data type. A pointer itself is a variable that points to any other variable. It can be of type int, char, array, function, or even any other pointer. Pointers in C++ are defined using the ‘*’ (asterisk) operator.</p>
        
        <p>The ‘&’(ampersand) operator is called the ‘address of’ operator, and the ‘*’(asterisk) operator is called the ‘value at’ dereference operator.</p>
        
        <h2>Applications of a Pointer</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Pointers are used to dynamically allocate or deallocate memory.</li>
          <li>Pointers are used to point to several containers such as arrays, or structs, and also for passing addresses of containers to functions.</li>
          <li>Return multiple values from a function.</li>
          <li>Rather than passing a copy of a container to a function, we can simply pass its pointer. This helps reduce the memory usage of the program.</li>
          <li>Pointer reduces the code and improves the performance.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h1>Operations on Pointers</h1>
        
        <h2>Address of Operator (&)</h2>
        <p>& is also known as the Referencing Operator. It is a unary operator. The variable name used along with the Address of operator must be the name of an already defined variable.</p>
        
        <p>Using & operator along with a variable gives the address number of the variable.</p>
        
        <h2>Indirection Operator</h2>
        <p>* is also known as the Dereferencing Operator. It is a unary operator. It takes an address as its argument and returns the content/container whose address is its argument.</p>
        
        <h2>Pointer to Pointer</h2>
        <p>Pointer to Pointer is a simple concept, in which we store the address of one pointer to another pointer. This is also known as multiple indirections owing to the operator’s name. Here, the first pointer contains the address of the second pointer, which points to the address where the actual variable has its value stored.</p><br><br>
