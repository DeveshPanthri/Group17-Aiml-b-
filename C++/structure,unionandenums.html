        <h1>Structures in C++</h1>
        <p>Variables store only one piece of information and arrays of certain data types store the information of the same data type. Variables and arrays can handle a great variety of situations. But quite often, we have to deal with the collection of dissimilar data types. For dealing with cases where there is a requirement to store dissimilar data types, C++ provides a data type called ‘structure’. The structure is a user-defined data type that is available in C++. Structures are used to combine different types of data types, just like an array is used to combine the same type of data types.</p>
        
        <p>Another way to store data of dissimilar data types would have been constructing individual arrays, but that must be unorganized. It is to keep in mind that structure elements too are always stored in contiguous memory locations.</p>
        
        <h2>Features of Structs</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We can assign the values of a structure variable to another structure variable of the same type using the assignment operator.</li>
          <li>Structure can be nested within another structure which means structures can have their members as structures themselves.</li>
          <li>We can pass the structure variable to a function. We can pass the individual structure elements or the entire structure variable into the function as an argument. And functions can also return a structure variable.</li>
          <li>We can have a pointer pointing to a struct just like the way we can have a pointer pointing to an int, or a pointer pointing to a char variable.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Creating a struct element</h2>
        <p>We use the <code>struct</code> keyword to define the struct. The basic syntax for declaring a struct is:</p>
        
        <pre><code>struct structure_name {
            // structure_elements
        } structure_variable;</code></pre>
        
        <h2>Accessing struct elements</h2>
        <p>To access any of the values of a structure's members, we use the dot operator (.). This dot operator is coded between the structure variable name and the structure member that we wish to access.</p>
        
        <p>Before the dot operator, there must always be an already defined structure variable and after the dot operator, there must always be a valid structure element.</p>
        
        <h1>Unions in C++</h1>
        <p>Just like Structures, the union is a user-defined data type. They provide better memory management than structures. All the members in the unions share the same memory location.</p>
        
        <p>The union is a data type that allows different data belonging to different data types to be stored in the same memory locations. One of the advantages of using a union over structures is that it provides an efficient way of reusing the memory location, as only one of its members can be accessed at a time. A union is used in the same way we declare and use a structure. The difference lies just in the way memory is allocated to their members.</p>
        
        <h2>Creating a Union element</h2>
        <p>We use the <code>union</code> keyword to define the union. The syntax for defining a union is:</p>
        
        <pre><code>union union_name {
            // union_elements
        } union_variable;</code></pre>
        
        <h1>Enums in C++</h1>
        <p>Enum or enumeration is a user-defined data type. Enums have named constants that represent integral values. Enums are used to make the program more readable and less complex. It lets us define a fixed set of possible values and later define variables having one of those values.</p>
        
        <h2>Creating an Enum element</h2>
        <p>We use the <code>enum</code> keyword to define the enum. The syntax for defining an enum is:</p>
        
        <pre><code>enum enum_name {
            element1,
            element2,
            element3
        };</code></pre>
        
        <p>Here’s an example of how an enum is defined and used in main as a user-defined data type:</p>
        
        <pre><code>enum Meal {
            breakfast,
            lunch,
            dinner
        };</code></pre>
