    <h1>C Overview</h1><br><h2>What is C?</h2> <p>Since the late 19th century, C has been a popular programming language for general-purpose use.</p> <p>C language was developed by Dennis M. Ritchie at Bell Laboratories in the early 1970s.</p> <p>Its applications are very diverse, ranging from developing operating systems to databases and beyond. It is a system programming language used for low-level programming (e.g., driver or kernel).</p> <p>Even if itâ€™s old, it is still a very popular programming language.</p> <p>As the whole UNIX operating system was written in C, it has a strong association with the operating system.</p> <p>C has also been used widely while creating iOS and Android kernels.</p> <p>MySQL database is written using C.</p> <p>Ruby and Perl are mostly written using C.</p> <p>Most parts of Apache and NGINX are written using C.</p> <p>Embedded Systems are created using C.</p> <h2>Why should we learn C? / Features of C</h2> <p>As mentioned above, it is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.</p> <p>Learning any other popular programming language such as Python or C++ becomes a cakewalk if you know C.</p> <p>C is a flexible language, proven by the fact that it can be used in a variety of applications and technologies.</p> <p>C is very fast compared to other programming languages like Java or Python.</p> <p>C takes only significant CPU time for interpretation. That is why a lot of Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Scikit-learn, etc. are built using C.</p> <p>Being close to machine language, some of its functions include direct access to machine-level hardware APIs.</p> <p>It is a structural language (follows a specific structure) and a compiled language.</p> <p>It is a procedural programming language (POP). Procedural Programming is the use of code in a step-wise procedure to develop applications.</p> <h2>How is it different from C++?</h2> <p>The syntax of C++ is almost identical to that of C, as C++ was developed as an extension of C.</p> <p>In contrast to C, C++ supports classes and objects, while C does not.</p> <p>C gives most of the control to the hands of users. Things like memory allocation and manipulation are totally in the hands of the programmer. Being a flexible language, it provides more access to the programmer, making it more efficient.</p> <p>C is POP (procedural-oriented programming), whereas C++ is OOP (object-oriented programming).</p> <br> <br>
