    <br><h1>Function Basics</h1><br> <br><h2>Functions:</h2><br> <ul> <li>Functions are used to divide a large C program into smaller and less complex pieces.</li> <li>A function can be called multiple or several times to provide reusability and modularity to the C program.</li> <li>Functions are also called procedures, subroutines, or methods.</li> <li>A function is also a piece of code that performs a specific task.</li> </ul> <p>A function is nothing but a group of code put together and given a name, and it can be called anytime without writing the whole code again and again in a program.</p> <p>I know its syntax is a bit difficult to understand but donâ€™t worry, after reading this whole information about Functions you will know each and every term or thing related to Functions.</p> <br><h2>Advantages of Functions</h2><br> <ul> <li>The use of functions allows us to avoid re-writing the same logic or code over and over again.</li> <li>With the help of functions, we can divide the work among the programmers.</li> <li>We can easily debug or find bugs in any program using functions.</li> <li>They make code readable and less complex.</li> </ul> <br><h3>Aspects of a function</h3><br> <br><h3>Declaration</h3><br> <p>This is where a function is declared to tell the compiler about its existence.</p> <br><h3>Definition</h3><br> <p>A function is defined to get some task executed. (It means when we define a function, we write the whole code of that function and this is where the actual implementation of the function is done.)</p> <br><h3>Call</h3><br> <p>This is where a function is called in order to be used.</p> <br><h2>Types of functions</h2><br> <br><h3>Library functions</h3><br> <p>Library functions are pre-defined functions in C Language. These are the functions that are included in C header files prior to any other part of the code in order to be used.</p> <p>E.g. printf(), scanf(), etc.</p> <br><h3>User-defined functions</h3><br> <p>User-defined functions are functions created by the programmer for the reduction of the complexity of a program. Rather, these are functions that the user creates as per the requirements of a program.</p> <p>E.g. Any function created by the programmer.</p> <br><h1>Functions Declaration</h1><br> <p>A function consists of two parts:</p> <ul> <li>Declaration, where we specify the function's name, its return type, and required parameters (if any).</li> <li>Definition, which is nothing but the body of the function (code to be executed).</li> </ul> <p>The basic structure of a function is:</p> <br> <pre> return_type functionName() <br> { // declaration // body of the function (definition) } </pre> <br> <p>For code optimization and readability, it is often recommended to separate the declaration and the definition of the function.</p> <p>This is the reason why you will often see C programs that have function declarations above the main() function, and function definitions below the main() function. This will make the code better organized and easier to read.</p> <p>This is how it is done:</p> <br> <pre> #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; <br>// Function declaration void func(); <br>int main() <br> { func(); // calling the function return 0; } <br> // Function definition void func() <br> { printf("This is the definition part."); } </pre> <br> <p>Output:</p> <p>This is the definition part <br><br>
