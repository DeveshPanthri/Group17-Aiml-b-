Navigate into the Program Files. Then, open MinGW-64. Open MinGW-32. And then the bin folder. After reaching the bin, save the path or URL to the bin.</li> <li>Then go to the properties of ‘This PC’.</li> <li>Select ‘Advance System Settings’.</li> <li>Select the ‘Environment Variable’ option.</li> <li>Add the copied path to the Environment Variable.</li> <li>And now, you can visit your IDE and run your C programs on it. The configuration part is done.</li> </ol><br>` <br>
